</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. Financial Terms </strong>
</p>
<p>
    4.1 Service Order Fee Calculation and Your Payment. You are entitled to charge a fee for each instance of completed Service Orders provided to a User that
    are obtained via the Fixd Repair Services (“Service Order Fee”), where such Service Order Fee is calculated based upon a <em>service estimate </em>(as
    determined by Company using estimation methodology enabled through the Device) and/or time amounts for the applicable Territory (“Service Order Fee
    Calculation”). Additionally, Service Order Fee is subject to change due to any adjustments to the service estimate made by the Service Pro and accepted by
    the User. After an adjusted estimate, the total fee shall be agreed to by the Service Pro and the User. You acknowledge and agree that the Service Order
    Fee, including any agreed upon adjustment, is the only payment you will receive in connection with the provision of Service Order, and that neither the
    Service Order Fee nor the Service Order Fee Calculation includes any gratuity. You are also entitled to charge User for any taxes or fees incurred during
    the provision of the Service Order, if applicable. You: (i) appoint Company as your limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting
    the Service Order Fee, and, depending on the region and/or if requested by you, applicable taxes and fees from the User on your behalf via the payment
    processing functionality facilitated by the Fixd Repair Pro Services and the Fixd Repair Services; and (ii) agree that payment made by User to Company (or
    to an Affiliate of Company acting as an agent of Company) shall be considered the same as payment made directly by User to you. In addition, the parties
    acknowledge and agree that as between you and Company, the Service Order Fee is a recommended amount, and the primary purpose of the pre-arranged Service
    Order Fee is to act as the default amount in the event you do not adjust the service order. You shall always have the right to: (i) charge a fare that is
    less than the pre-arranged Service Order Fee; or (ii) negotiate, at your request, a Service Order Fee that is lower than the prearranged Service Order Fee
    (each of (i) and (ii) herein, a “Negotiated Fee”). Company shall consider all such requests from you in good faith. Company agrees to remit, or cause to be
    remitted, to you within three business days: the Service Order Fee less the applicable Revenue Sharing Fee; and depending on the region, certain taxes and
    ancillary fees. If you have separately agreed that other amounts may be deducted from the Service Order Fee prior to remittance to you (e.g., Fees
    initially incurred by Company on your behalf for background checks, Equipment lease payments, mobile device usage charges, etc.), the order of any such
    deductions from the Service Order Fee shall be determined exclusively by Company (as between you and Company).
</p>
<p>
    4.2 Changes to Service Order Fee Calculation. Company reserves the right to change the Service Order Fee Calculation at any time in Company’s discretion
    based upon local market factors, and Company will provide you with notice in the event of changes to the base fare, per mile, and/or per minute amounts
    that would result in a change in the recommended Service Order Fee. Continued use of the Fixd Repair Pro Services after any such change in the Service
    Order Fee Calculation shall constitute your consent to such change.
</p>
<p>
    4.3 Service Order Fee Adjustment. Company reserves the right to: (i) adjust the Service Order Fee for a particular instance during a Service Order (e.g.,
    there was a more cost-efficient method to perform the Service Order, you failed to repair the subject of the Service Order, technical error in the Fixd
    Repair Services or Fixd Repair Pro Services, etc.); or (ii) cancel the Service Order Fee for a particular instance during a Service Order (e.g., User is
    charged for a Service Order that was not provided, in the event of a User complaint, fraud, etc.). Company’s decision to reduce or cancel the Service Order
    Fee in any such manner shall be exercised in a reasonable manner.
</p>
<p>
    4.4 Revenue Sharing Fee. In consideration of Company’s provision of the Fixd Repair Pro App and the Fixd Repair Pro Services for your use and benefit
    hereunder, you agree to pay Company a service fee on a per Service Order transaction basis calculated as a percentage of the Service Order Fee determined
    by the Service Order Fee Calculation (regardless of any Negotiated Fee), as provided to you via email or otherwise made available electronically by Company
    from time to time for the applicable Territory (“Revenue Sharing Fee”). In the event regulations applicable to your Territory require taxes to be
    calculated on the Service Order Fee, Company shall calculate the Revenue Sharing Fee based on the Service Order Fee net of such taxes. Company reserves the
    right to change the Revenue Sharing Fee at any time in Company’s discretion based upon local market factors, and Company will provide you with notice in
    the event of such change. Continued use of the Fixd Repair Pro Services after any such change in the Revenue Sharing Fee calculation shall constitute your
    consent to such change.
</p>
<p>
    4.5 Cancellation Charges. You acknowledge and agree that Users may elect to cancel requests for Service Orders that have been accepted by you via the Fixd
    Repair Pro App at any time prior to your arrival. In the event that a User cancels an accepted request for a Service Order, Company may charge the User a
    cancellation fee on your behalf. If charged, this cancellation fee shall be deemed the Service Order Fee for the cancelled Service Order for the purpose of
    remittance to you hereunder (“Trip Fee”). The parties acknowledge and agree that as between you and Company, this Trip Fee will be determined at the time
    of booking a Service Order. You shall always have the right to: (i) charge a cancellation fee that is less than the Cancellation Fee; or (ii) negotiate, at
    your request, a cancellation fee that is lower than the Cancellation Fee (each of (i) and (ii) herein, a “Negotiated Cancellation Fee”). If charged, the
    Cancellation Fee (regardless of any Negotiated Cancellation Fee) shall be deemed the Service Order Fee for the cancelled Service Order for the purpose of
    remittance to you hereunder.
</p>
<p>
    4.6 Receipts. As part of the Fixd Repair Pro Services, Company provides you a system for the delivery of receipts to Users for Service Orders rendered.
    Upon your completion of a Service Order for a User, Company prepares an applicable receipt and issues such receipt to the User via email on your behalf.
    Such receipts are also provided to you via email, the online portal available to you through the Fixd Repair Pro Services, and are available in both the
    Mobile Application and the Site for both the User and the Pro. Receipts include the breakdown of amounts charged to the User for the Service Orders and may
    include specific information about you, including your name, contact information and photo, as well as a description of the Home Repair Services completed
    or the Home Repair Services that were recommended. Any corrections to a User’s receipt for Service Orders must be submitted to Company in writing within
    three (3) business days after the completion of such Service Orders. Absent such a notice, Company shall not be liable for any mistakes in or corrections
    to the receipt or for recalculation or disbursement of the Service Order Fee.
</p>
<p>
    4.7 No Additional Amounts. You acknowledge and agree that, for the mutual benefit of the parties, through advertising and marketing, Company and its
    Affiliates may seek to attract new Users to Fixd Repair and to increase existing Users’ use of the Fixd Repair App. You acknowledge and agree such
    advertising or marketing does not entitle you to any additional monetary amounts beyond the amounts expressly set forth in this Agreement.

    related to your completion of Service Orders as required by applicable law; and (b) provide Company with all relevant tax information. You further

    contrary in this Agreement, Company may in its reasonable discretion based on applicable tax and regulatory considerations, collect and remit taxes
    resulting from your provision of Service Orders and/or provide any of the relevant tax information you have provided pursuant to the foregoing requirements
    in this Section 4.8 directly to the applicable governmental tax authorities on your behalf or otherwise.

    less protective than the terms hereof; and (d) it shall return or destroy all Confidential Information of the disclosing party, upon the termination of

    obligation of confidentiality; (c) is disclosed to the receiving party by a third party having no obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto; or

    conflict, including an accident, between you and a User; (b) it is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement; (c) it is required, in Company’s or

    pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity); or (e) it is required or necessary, in Company’s or any Affiliate’s sole
    discretion, for insurance or other purposes related to your ability to qualify, or remain qualified, to use the Fixd Repair Pro Services. You understand
    that Company may retain your personal data for legal, regulatory, safety and other necessary purposes after this Agreement is terminated.
</p>
<p>
    7.2 Company and its Affiliates may collect your personal data during the course of your application for, and use of, the Fixd Repair Pro Services, or may
    obtain information about you from third parties. Such information may be stored, processed, transferred, and accessed by Company and its Affiliates, third
    parties, and service providers for business purposes, including for marketing, lead generation, service development and improvement, analytics, industry
    and market research, and such other purposes consistent with Company’s and its Affiliates’ legitimate business needs. You expressly consent to such use of
    personal data.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8. Insurance </strong>
</p>
<p>
    8.1 You agree to maintain during the term of this Agreement on all vehicles operated by you under this Agreement automobile liability insurance that
    provides protection against bodily injury and property damage to third parties at levels of coverage that satisfy the minimum requirements to operate a
    private passenger vehicle on the public roads within the Territory. This coverage must also include any no-fault coverage required by law in the Territory
    that may not be waived by an insured. You agree to provide Company and its Affiliates a copy of the insurance policy, policy declarations, proof of
    insurance identification card and proof of premium payment for the insurance policy required in this Section 8.1 upon request. Furthermore, you must
    provide Company with written notice of cancellation of any insurance policy required by Company. Company shall have no right to control your selection or
    maintenance of your policy. You must be a named insured or individually rated driver, for which a premium is charged, on the insurance policy required in
    this Section 8.1 at all times.
</p>
<p> 
    If you are operating your vehicle in Texas, the minimum liability limits are $30,000 for each injured person, up to a total of $60,000 per accident, and
    $25,000 for property damage per accident.
</p>
<p>
    8.2 You agree to maintain during the term of this Agreement workers’ compensation insurance as required by all applicable laws in the Territory. If
    permitted by applicable law, you may choose to insure yourself against industrial injuries by maintaining occupational accident insurance in place of

    do so at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
    8.3 You understand and acknowledge that your personal automobile insurance policy may not afford liability, comprehensive, collision, medical payments,
    personal injury protection, uninsured motorist, underinsured motorist, or other coverage for transportation to the Service Orders you provide pursuant to
    this Agreement. If you have any questions or concerns about the scope or applicability of your own insurance coverage, it is your responsibility, not that
    of Company, to resolve them with your insurer(s).
</p>
<p>
    8.4 Company may maintain during the term of this Agreement insurance related to your provision of Service Orders as determined by Company in its reasonable
    discretion or as described in a City Addendum, provided that Company and its Affiliates are not required to provide you with any specific insurance
    coverage for any loss to you. You are required to promptly notify Company of any accidents that occur while performing Service Orders and to cooperate and
    provide all necessary information related thereto.
</p>
<p>
    8.5 You agree to maintain during the term of this Agreement on all Home Repair Services provided by you under this Agreement adequate insurance and
    licensing that meets the minimum requirements of all applicable laws within the Territory for the scope of work performed by you.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>15. Governing Law; Arbitration </strong>
</p>
<p>
    15.1 The choice of law provisions contained in this Section 15.1 do not apply to the arbitration clause contained in Section 15.3, such arbitration clause
    being governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Accordingly, and except as otherwise stated in Section 15.3, the interpretation of this Agreement shall be
    governed by Texas law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction. Any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action
    arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Fixd Repair Pro Services that are not subject to the arbitration clause contained in Section
    15.3 shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the City and County of Dallas, Texas. However, neither the
    choice of law provision regarding the interpretation of this Agreement nor the forum selection provision is intended to create any other substantive right
    to non-Texans to assert claims under Texas law whether that be by statute, common law, or otherwise. These provisions, and except as otherwise provided in
    Section 15.3, are only intended to specify the use of Texas law to interpret this Agreement and the forum for disputes asserting a breach of this
    Agreement, and these provisions shall not be interpreted as generally extending Texas law to you if you do not otherwise reside or provide services in
    Texas. The foregoing choice of law and forum selection provisions do not apply to the arbitration clause in Section 15.3 or to any arbitrable disputes as
    defined therein. Instead, as described in Section 15.3, the Federal Arbitration Act shall apply to any such disputes. The failure of Company to enforce any
    right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Fixd Repair in writing.
</p>
<p>
    15.2 Other than disputes regarding the intellectual property rights of the parties and other claims identified in Section 15.3.ii, any disputes, actions,
    claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Fixd Repair Pro Services shall be subject to arbitration pursuant to
    Section 15.3.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>15.3 Arbitration Provision </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Important Note Regarding this Arbitration Provision:
</p>
<p>
    Except as provided below, arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you may bring against the Company. Agreeing to arbitration only affects
    where any such claims may be brought and how they will be resolved.
</p>
<p>
    IMPORTANT: This Arbitration Provision will require you to resolve any claim that you may have against the Company on an individual basis, except as
    provided below, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement unless you choose to opt out of the Arbitration Provision. Except as provided below, this provision
    will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against the Company, and also precludes you from participating in or
    recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, or representative action brought against the Company by someone else.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        However, as discussed above and except as provided below, if you agree to arbitration, you will not be precluded from bringing your claims against the
        Company in an individual arbitration proceeding. If successful on such claims, you could be awarded money or other relief by an arbitrator (subject to
        splitting the cost of arbitration as mentioned above).
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    15.3.1 How This Arbitration Provision Applies.
</p>
<p>
    This Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) and evidences a transaction involving interstate
    commerce. This Arbitration Provision applies to any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or termination of the Agreement and survives after
    the Agreement terminates. Nothing contained in this Arbitration Provision shall be construed to prevent or excuse you from utilizing any informal procedure
    for resolution of complaints established in this Agreement (if any), and this Arbitration Provision is not intended to be a substitute for the utilization
    of such procedures.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a
        court of law or before any forum other than arbitration, with the exception of proceedings that must be exhausted under applicable law before pursuing
        a claim in a court of law or in any forum other than arbitration. Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision requires all such
        disputes to be resolved only by an arbitrator through final and binding arbitration on an individual basis only and not by way of court or jury trial,
        or by way of class, collective, or representative action.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Except as provided in Section 15.3(v), below, regarding the Class Action Waiver, such disputes include without limitation disputes arising out of or
    relating to interpretation or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration
    Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision. All such matters shall be decided by an Arbitrator and not by a court or judge. However, as set
    forth below, the preceding sentences shall not apply to disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the Class Action Waiver below, including
    their enforceability, revocability or validity.
</p>
<p>
    Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision also applies, without limitation, to all disputes between You and the Company, as well as all
    disputes between You and the Company’s fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, and all successors and assigns of any of them,
    including but not limited to any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and disputes arising out of or related to your relationship with the
    Company, including termination of the relationship. This Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute that lawfully can be
    arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of this Agreement are expressly excluded from the Arbitration Provision.
</p>
<p>
    15.3.2 Limitations On How This Agreement Applies.
</p>
<p>
    The disputes and claims set forth below shall not be subject to arbitration and the requirement to arbitrate set forth in this Arbitration Provision shall
    not apply:
</p>
<p>
    a. Claims for workers compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits;
</p>
<p>
    b. Regardless of any other terms of this Agreement, nothing in this Arbitration Provision shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from making a
    report to, filing a claim or charge with, or bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust
    administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration and nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Provision prevents the investigation by a
    government agency of any report, claim, or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration provision;
</p>
<p>
    c. Disputes that may not be subject to a predispute arbitration agreement pursuant to applicable Federal law or Executive Order are excluded from the
    coverage of this Arbitration Provision;
</p>
<p>
    d. Disputes regarding your or the Company’s intellectual property rights;
</p>
<p>
    15.3.3 Selecting The Arbitrator and Location of the Arbitration.
</p>
<p>
    The Arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the Company and you. Unless you and the Company mutually agree otherwise, the Arbitrator shall be
    an attorney licensed to practice in the location where the arbitration proceeding will be conducted or a retired federal or state judicial officer who
    presided in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. If the Parties cannot agree on an Arbitrator, then an arbitrator will be selected
    using the applicable arbitrator selection rules provided by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or
    by calling 1-800-778-7879.
</p>
<p>
    The arbitration shall take place in the state and county in which you last performed a Service order under this Agreement, unless each party to the
    arbitration agrees in writing otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    15.3.4 Starting The Arbitration.
</p>
<p>
    All claims in arbitration are subject to the same statutes of limitation that would apply in court. Any demand for arbitration made to the Company shall be
    provided to Fixd Repair, LLC, ATTN: Legal, 8600 Freeport Parkway, Suite 400, Irving TX, 75063. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes regarding the
    timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration. A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive
    relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered
    ineffectual without such provisional relief.
</p>
<p>
    15.3.5 How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted.
</p>
<p>
    In arbitration, the Parties will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as
    needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the Arbitrator.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        You and the Company agree to resolve any dispute that is in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective action, or
        representative basis (“Class Action Waiver”).
    </strong>
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Provision or the American Arbitration Association Rules &amp; Procedures, disputes
    regarding the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not
    by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial
    determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective, and/or representative action to that extent must be
    litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.
</p>
<p>
    15.3.6 Paying For The Arbitration.
</p>
<p>
    Each party will pay the fees for his, her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law
    (i.e., a party prevails on a claim that provides for the award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party). In all cases where required by law,
    the Company will pay the Arbitrator's and arbitration fees. If under applicable law the Company is not required to pay all of the Arbitrator’s and/or
    arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned equally between the Parties or as otherwise required by applicable law. However, you will not be required
    to bear any type of fee or expense that you would not be required to bear if you had filed the action in a court of law. Any disputes in that regard will
    be resolved by the Arbitrator as soon as practicable after the Arbitrator is selected, and Company shall bear all of the Arbitrator’s and arbitration fees
    until such time as the Arbitrator resolves any such dispute.
</p>
<p>
    15.3.7 The Arbitration Hearing and Award.
</p>
<p>
    The Parties will arbitrate their dispute before the Arbitrator, who shall confer with the Parties regarding the conduct of the hearing and resolve any
    disputes the Parties may have in that regard. Within 30 days of the close of the arbitration hearing, or within a longer period of time as agreed to by the
    Parties or as ordered by the Arbitrator, any party will have the right to prepare, serve on the other party and file with the Arbitrator a brief. The
    Arbitrator may award any party any remedy to which that party is entitled under applicable law, but such remedies shall be limited to those that would be
    available to a party in his or her individual capacity in a court of law for the claims presented to and decided by the Arbitrator, and no remedies that
    otherwise would be available to an individual in a court of law will be forfeited by virtue of this Arbitration Provision. The Arbitrator will issue a
    decision or award in writing, stating the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to
    enter a judgment upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration. The Arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, and
    the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>15.3.8 </strong>
    <strong>Your Right To Opt Out Of Arbitration. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of your contractual relationship with the Company. If you do not want to be subject to this Arbitration
