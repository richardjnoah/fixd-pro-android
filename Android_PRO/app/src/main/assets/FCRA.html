            <p>A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act</p>
            <p>
            	The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information 
                .in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including 
                credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, 
                medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For 
                more information, including information about additional rights, go to <a href="http://consumerfinance.gov/learnmore">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a> or 
                write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.
            </p>
            <p>
            	- You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another 
                type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment – or to take another adverse 
                action against you – must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided 
                the information. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	- You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the 
                information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your “file disclosure”). 
                You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security 
                number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if
                <span>
                	a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report; 
                </span>
                <span>
                	you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file; 
                </span>
                <span>
                	your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud; 
                    you are on public assistance; 
                </span>
                <span>
                	you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days. 
                    In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each
                    nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. 
                    See <a href="http://consumerfinance.gov/learnmore">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a> for additional information.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
            	- You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of 
                your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer 
                reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you 
                will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.
            </p>
            <p>
            	- You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your 
                file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must 
                investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See <a href="http://consumerfinance.gov/learnmore">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a> for an explanation 
                of dispute procedures. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	- Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. 
                Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. 
                However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	- Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a 
                consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, 
                or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	- Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you 
                only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, 
                employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	- You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting 
                agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, 
                without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required 
                in the trucking industry. For more information, go to <a href="http://consumerfinance.gov/learnmore">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	- You may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in 
                your credit report. Unsolicited “prescreened” offers for credit and insurance must include a 
                toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists 
                these offers are based on. You may opt out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688). 
            </p>
            <p>
            	- You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a 
                user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the 
                FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	- Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. 
                For more information, visit www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.
                States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, 
                you may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state or local 
                consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General. For information about your federal rights, contact:
